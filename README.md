## Coding 
Some of the best resources for coding are on the web and the best way to learn a language is to practice it so there are not many resources here on a particular language. To learn a new language, find a tutorial and then make sure you _write the code_. it doesn't matter if you start by copying the tutorial, just make sure you type it all out. This is important because you are teaching yourself on two different levels. One - you're learning to understand on a conscious level what the purpose of the language is and how it was designed. Different languages are good for different things. Two - you must also teach your subconscious to respond to different queues in the unfamiliar environment and train your hands to automatically use various keyboard shortcuts. Different languages have different syntax and it is important to type it out to train your subconscious. The goal is for your subconscious to support you effortlessly so your conscious has more energy to formulate ideas.
